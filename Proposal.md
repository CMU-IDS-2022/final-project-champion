**Question**: Which location should young adults rent from based on trends from pre-pandemic housing, pandemic housing and post pandemic housing prices?

The housing prices in the United States have always been fluctuating. There is much attention focused on housing purchase prices but not so much on housing rental cost for practical reasons. This is even more evident in recent years due to the pandemic as more people are working from home. With such huge changes, young adults like us are unsure where would be a good place to rent houses from. With so many things happening, we have decided to analyze how rental prices in housing have changed pre-pandemic, during the pandemic and even possibly forecast how it would change post pandemic. We want to provide these information to the users so that they can make a more informed decision on where to rent if given a choice to work remotely anywhere.

With many general trends of housing rentals in the United States, we want to focus more on the granularity data in deciding where to rent. Hence, we decided to use a bottom up approach in our analysis. We will sieve out the top 10 cities which students who graduated from CMU go to based on the data [here](https://www.cmu.edu/career/outcomes/post-grad-dashboard.html). Then, within each city, we will try to analyze the housing rental cost for various types of housing and how various characteristics of the locations affect the rental cost. These will be compared across the pandemic periods. We will then zoom up to analyze the general trends of the city rental cost to the state and finally across states in the United States.

In terms of data, we have found many recent rental datas of various characteristics on the [Zillow website](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). We also found other sources of data from the [government](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx). Given the wide topic of housing rental cost, we believe we are able to find more datasets if needed.

As we believe that this project can be scoped further to provide more information to the users in deciding where to rent. If time allows, we would want to add in some analysis to possible reasons as to why the prices have changed in value or even cost of living data to help the users.
