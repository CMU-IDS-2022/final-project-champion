**Question**: Which location in the United States and what price should young adults these days pay for rental based on housing trends from pre-pandemic, pandemic and post pandemic prices predictions?

The housing prices in the United States have always been fluctuating. There is much attention focused on sales of housing prices but not so much on housing rental cost. This is even more evident in recent years due to the pandemic as more people are working from home, causing the prices for cities to drop as people start to [rent in suburban areas](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/10/zillow-and-census-bureau-data-show-pandemics-impact-on-housing-market.html#:~:text=working%20from%20home.-,Zillow%20found%20that%20nearly%20two%20million%20renters%20unable%20to%20afford,pandemic%20hit%20the%20United%20States.). With such ongoing changes, young adults like us are unsure where and what price to pay to rent a house to be worth. As such, we have decided to analyze how rental prices in housing have changed pre-pandemic, during the pandemic and even possibly use machine learning algorithms to forecast how it would be in post pandemic days. We want to provide an all in one rental cost visualization platform for users to make a more informed decision on where to rent and how much to pay if given a preference in location and type of housing.

With many general trends of housing rentals online in the United States, we want to focus more on the granularity data in deciding where to rent. Hence, we decided to use a bottom up approach in our analysis. We will sieve out the top 10 cities which students who graduated from CMU go to based on the data [here](https://www.cmu.edu/career/outcomes/post-grad-dashboard.html). Then, within each city, we will try to analyze the housing rental cost across the years, through the pandemic periods accounting for various types of housing and different characteristics of the locations, like crime rate, neighborhood, safety etc. We will share a range of acceptable rental prices for the user who wants to rent in that area. After analyzing the cities in detail, we will then zoom up to analyze the general trends of the city rental cost to the state and finally across states in the United States.

In terms of data, we have found many recent rental datas of various characteristics on the [Zillow website](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) that is up to date to this year. We also found other sources of data from the [government](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx). Given the wide topic of housing rental cost, we believe we are able to find more datasets if needed.

After we finish the visualization aspect of the project using existing data, we hope to make use of the data to run some simple machine learning models to predict future rental housing prices based on certain assumptions. As we believe that this project can be scoped further to provide more information to the users in deciding where to rent. If time allows, we would want to add in some analysis to possible reasons as to why the prices have changed in value or even cost of living data to help the users.
